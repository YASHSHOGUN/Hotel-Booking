It was an experience we will cherish for our lives and it started from the moment we entered. We felt like warm and welcoming atmosphere that was perfect for me and my sons and the décor was so cosy that even if it was modern, far from home it made us feel right at home and the swimming pool experience was a never forgettable  experience and   most thing that made it the best thing is that The food.  We ordered for lunch was delivered in charming woollen. That we enjoyed while relaxing by the pool. The setup was so cool that we ordered the food for 3 straight days in pool itself. While they had the wide variety of options, we specifically choose their most recommended the great Indian veg platter and the Chinese seafood platter,  Which we used to eat at least once per year. In korea  where our home is located, and the staff and service were splendid. especially the cosplay  done by the staff. It was so awesome that it made me feel like living in my youthful day. World which arose the memories, buried deep in my heart with the youthful experience.  And memories flooded the whole floor in the end.And aura, the experience were so good.then also , the ambience  cannot be forgotten and also the place where it was located was so safe and clean that we made it feel like our own korean streets.love from koreaaaaa🇰🇷

                              <div class="message">I recently embarked on a solo trip with my pet dog zoewirsha and it was immediately After going through a love failure and I stayed at the 4S hotel that made me a journey to heal and turned into an incredible experience filled with unexpected joy and new beginnings. The hotel is nested in a picturesque setting and it immediately lifted my spirits. The beautiful garden, the fountains, the scenery and the whole scene. It went there?  When rain poured down, it lifted my spirits into skies once again. And according to the accommodation I opted for the 7 nights and 8 days package, which included an array of services that made my stay comfortable and exciting. And the staff was so outstanding handling every task and they were so friendly and professional. In one word, we can say that they are the multi-talented people we connected so deeply.  And especially I found my true love there. He was assigned as a manager to me and he took care of me and my pet during the whole trip at the sightseeing of the city and also when I was back to my room, we exchanged our contacts even though we are from different background that is I'm from usa  while he's from India, there are no boundaries and there's this same applicable to the hotel motto, that whole world is one family well I'm going to get engaged soon to the love i found there . Well and also the hotel's pet care service was so exceptional and topnotch. That Zoe wirsha was taken care of with care Regular walks play time and special activities and treats.  And the package included city side scene, which was an incredible way to explore and make memories and also the most thing was the public sauna which is only  present in this hotel It is simply a public bath, but it was same level as in Japan.  And my boyfriend that is soon going to be My husband enjoyed a lot in there.Well, during my stay, we can say that it is new friendship which made me heal through my path.And it gave me fresh perspective on life and I highly recommend to you guys to visit it at least once in your lifetime who knows which way the leaf turns and I especially opt you guys to take in the room no 305 and also do visit there main  haveli which are only for community activities and also I deeply connected with my husband ohh my soon to be husband</div>
